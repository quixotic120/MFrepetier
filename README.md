Untested - set up for my (heavily modified) makerfarm pegasus (see branch MFMarlin as well) using my ramps-fd variation (see branch RAMPS-FD3)

of primary interest will be pins.h if anyone who makes my ramps-fd variation. Otherwise this is just configured for the my machine specifically and not meant to be a general “makerfarm” release
